# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.

The present report gives a short overview about outcomes of the fundraising campaigns for theatrical plays in period 2009-2017. 

In the period between 2009-2019 were placed 1066 fundraising campaigns for theatrical plays, 19 of which are still in progress. 694 projects have reached their goal and 353 were unsuccessful. There were no cancelled projects.

Campaigns that had a goal less than $5000 had a highest proportion of successful projects (73%-75%). Also almost the same picture (63% of successful campaigns) was observed  among projects that had a goal $35000-$44999, however because of low numbers of such campaigns, there are some limits in using this data for planning future projects.

Also according the analysis, among the projects that were started in the period 2009-2017, the highest number of successful projects (111) were started in May. It amounts to 67% of all projects started in this month in the period between 2009-2017. However, if each year considered separately there is no explicit answer, which month is more favorable for starting new project. 

For full picture itâ€™s recommended to make an additional analysis that will cover the following aspects:
1.  Is there are any significant correlation between sum of the goal and the outcome of the project if we consider it year by year?
2. Does the launch month have a significant impact on the  outcome of the project year by year?
3. Does the length of the project have a significant influence on its success?
